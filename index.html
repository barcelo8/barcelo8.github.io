<h2>Why is it better than flying?</h2>
<p>There is no extra fees for traveling on a train. The seats are much more comfortable on a train than on a plane. And instead of heated up food on a plane, the food is made on board.</p>

<h2>Why is it better than driving?</h2>
<p>There is no maps, no traffic, or having to worry about anything, just sit back and relax. Your back won't hurt from sitting in a seat with thin cushions for a long period of time.</p>

<h2>Why is it better than a bus?</h2>
<p>There is no food served on a bus. And, you can't stand up and walk around unless you are suing the restroom. The bathrooms are more dirty on a bus. And, more cramped space on a bus. And, you can't get any fresh air until your destination stop.</p>
<h2> Why is it better to travel by train?</h2>
<p>Food is made on board. There are big luggage racks in each car. Also, unlike airline coach seats, the coach seats on a train have huge space between each seat, and you get a big window. You are able to walk around the train and stretch your legs at a fresh air stop. You get large picture windows compared to on a bus, car, or plane. There are showers on board, but they are only for Sleeping Car passengers. As you can see, there are many reasons why it is better to travel by train.</P>
